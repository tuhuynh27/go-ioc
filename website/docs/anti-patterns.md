# Go Anti-Patterns and Migration Strategy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Consideration

**This library intentionally violates Go idioms and best practices.** While Go IoC is technically functional and performant, it introduces several anti-patterns that go against Go's design philosophy:

## Anti-Patterns Used

### Struct Embedding Abuse
- **Issue**: Empty struct fields as magic markers (`Component struct{}`, `Qualifier struct{}`)
- **Problem**: Adds runtime memory overhead for compile-time metadata, violates Go's explicit composition principle
- **Example**: 
```go
type EmailService struct {
    Component struct{} // Magic marker - not idiomatic Go
    Qualifier struct{} `value:"email"`
}
```

### Magic Behavior via Struct Tags
- **Issue**: Heavy reliance on struct tags for core functionality instead of explicit code
- **Problem**: Creates implicit coupling and a DSL that must be learned separately from Go
- **Example**:
```go
Logger logger.Logger `autowired:"true" qualifier:"console"` // Magic behavior hidden in tags
```

### Interface Pollution
- **Issue**: Upfront interface definitions rather than Go's "discover interfaces at point of use"
- **Problem**: Follows Java-style "design by interface" rather than Go's consumer-defined interfaces
- **Go Best Practice**: Interfaces should be small and defined by consumers, not providers

### Global State Pattern
- **Issue**: Generated Container acting as a service locator
- **Problem**: All dependencies accessible from single point, encourages reaching into container rather than explicit dependency passing
- **Example**:
```go
// Anti-pattern: Global container access
container := wire.Initialize()
service := container.NotificationService // Unclear dependencies
```

### Convention over Configuration
- **Issue**: Java Spring naming conventions rather than Go idioms
- **Problem**: Uses lifecycle methods like `PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy` instead of Go's context cancellation and defer patterns

## üéØ Why Build This Despite Anti-Patterns?

### Migration Bridge for Java Teams

This library serves as a **temporary migration tool** for teams transitioning from Java/Spring to Go. It provides:

1. **Familiar Patterns**: Reduces cognitive load for Spring developers learning Go
2. **Faster Initial Adoption**: Teams can be productive immediately without learning Go's dependency patterns  
3. **Gradual Learning Curve**: Allows teams to focus on Go syntax and tooling before tackling Go's architectural patterns

### Real-World Migration Scenarios

Many enterprise teams face challenges when moving from Java/Spring to Go:

- **Existing Knowledge**: Years of Spring experience shouldn't be discarded immediately
- **Team Productivity**: Need to maintain development velocity during transition
- **Risk Management**: Gradual adoption reduces risk of failed migrations
- **Learning Curve**: Go's explicit philosophy can be overwhelming when combined with new syntax

## üöÄ Clean Migration Path

### The Beauty of Compile-Time Generation

Since Go IoC leaves no runtime footprints, migration to idiomatic Go patterns is straightforward:

1. **Start with Go IoC**: Use familiar Spring-like patterns for initial development
2. **Learn Go Idioms**: Gradually understand Go's explicit dependency injection patterns
3. **Clean Removal**: Simply remove the marker structs and struct tags
4. **Refactor to Constructors**: Replace with explicit constructor functions

### Migration Example

**Before (Go IoC - Anti-pattern but familiar):**
```go
type NotificationService struct {
    Component struct{}
    EmailSender message.MessageService `autowired:"true" qualifier:"email"`
    SmsSender   message.MessageService `autowired:"true" qualifier:"sms"`
}

func (s *NotificationService) SendNotifications(msg string) {
    s.EmailSender.SendMessage(msg)
    s.SmsSender.SendMessage(msg)
}
```

**After (Idiomatic Go):**
```go
type NotificationService struct {
    emailSender message.MessageService
    smsSender   message.MessageService
}

func NewNotificationService(emailSender, smsSender message.MessageService) *NotificationService {
    return &NotificationService{
        emailSender: emailSender,
        smsSender:   smsSender,
    }
}

func (s *NotificationService) SendNotifications(msg string) {
    s.emailSender.SendMessage(msg)
    s.smsSender.SendMessage(msg)
}
```

### Step-by-Step Migration Process

1. **Identify Components**: List all Go IoC components in your codebase
2. **Remove Markers**: Delete `Component struct{}`, `Qualifier struct{}`, `Implements struct{}`
3. **Remove Tags**: Remove `autowired`, `qualifier`, `implements` struct tags
4. **Create Constructors**: Write explicit `New*` functions for each component
5. **Wire Dependencies**: Pass dependencies as constructor parameters
6. **Update Main**: Replace container initialization with explicit wiring
7. **Delete Generated Files**: Remove `wire/wire_gen.go` and related generated code

## üéØ Go-Idiomatic Alternatives

### Explicit Constructor Pattern
```go
func NewEmailService(logger Logger, config *Config) *EmailService {
    return &EmailService{
        logger: logger,
        config: config,
    }
}

func NewNotificationService() *NotificationService {
    config := NewConfig()
    logger := NewConsoleLogger()
    emailService := NewEmailService(logger, config)
    smsService := NewSMSService(logger, config)
    
    return &NotificationService{
        emailService: emailService,
        smsService:   smsService,
        logger:       NewJSONLogger(),
    }
}
```

### Functional Options Pattern
```go
type ServiceOption func(*NotificationService)

func WithEmailService(svc EmailService) ServiceOption {
    return func(ns *NotificationService) {
        ns.emailService = svc
    }
}

func NewNotificationService(opts ...ServiceOption) *NotificationService {
    ns := &NotificationService{}
    for _, opt := range opts {
        opt(ns)
    }
    return ns
}
```

### Interface-Based Composition
```go
type Dependencies struct {
    Logger        Logger
    EmailService  MessageService
    SMSService    MessageService
}

func NewNotificationService(deps Dependencies) *NotificationService {
    return &NotificationService{
        logger:       deps.Logger,
        emailService: deps.EmailService,
        smsService:   deps.SMSService,
    }
}
```

## üéØ Recommendations

### For Production Go Applications
- **Use explicit constructors** and dependency passing
- **Prefer small interfaces** defined at the point of use
- **Use the functional options pattern** for complex initialization
- **Leverage Go's context package** for lifecycle management
- **Keep dependencies explicit** in function signatures

### For Java Teams Learning Go
- **Start with Go IoC** if it helps your team be productive initially
- **Plan migration timeline** to idiomatic Go patterns (3-6 months recommended)
- **Learn Go idioms gradually** while maintaining productivity
- **Use Go IoC analysis tools** to understand dependency relationships before migration

## üéØ Final Recommendation

**Remember**: The goal is not to make Go look like Java, but to help Java developers become productive Go developers faster.

**Verdict**: While technically functional, this DI approach fights against Go's design philosophy rather than embracing it. Go's strength lies in explicit, simple code that's easy to understand and debug. This library trades that clarity for annotation-based configuration that feels more at home in Java or C# than Go.

Use Go IoC as a bridge, not a destination.
