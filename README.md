# Go IoC: Bring "@Autowired" to Go!

Go IoC brings Spring-style autowiring to Go, offering a compile-time Inversion of Control (IoC) solution. Unlike Spring's runtime reflection-based `@Autowired`, Go IoC uses code generation to make dependencies explicit and type-safe at compile time, while keeping the familiar and intuitive struct tag syntax for dependency injection.

## Hasn't this been done already?

While other DI solutions exist in Go ([Google's Wire](https://github.com/google/wire/tree/main), [Uber's Dig](https://github.com/uber-go/dig) or [Facebook's Inject](https://github.com/facebookarchive/inject)), Go IoC takes a unique approach by:

- Providing a familiar Spring-like API that Java developers will recognize
- Using code generation for compile-time safety and zero runtime overhead (unlike Spring's runtime IoC)
- Using struct tags and marker structs as clean "annotations" 
- Supporting interface implementations and qualifiers elegantly
- Enabling automatic component scanning via struct marker
- Supporting lifecycle hooks via PostConstruct and PreDestroy struct methods

## But why bring @Autowired to Go?

For teams transitioning from Spring/Java to Go, especially those with significant Spring experience, dependency injection via `@Autowired` is more than just a familiar pattern — it's a proven productivity booster. Here's why I built Go IoC:

- **Smoother Java-to-Go Migration**: Many teams, including my team, come from a Spring background. Having a similar dependency injection pattern significantly reduces the learning curve and accelerates the transition to Go.

- **Proven Developer Experience**: Spring's autowiring has demonstrated for years that automatic dependency scanning and injection leads to:
  - Less boilerplate code for wiring dependencies
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code layers
  - Faster development cycles
  - Easier testing through dependency substitution

- **Best of Both Worlds**: While I love Spring's convenience, I also respect Go's philosophy of explicitness. That's why Go IoC:
  - Uses pure compile-time code generation
  - Makes dependencies traceable in generated code
  - Maintains compile-time type safety
  - Keeps the familiar developer experience without any runtime overhead

## How does it work?

Go IoC uses code generation to:

1. Scan struct tags at build time to identify components, interfaces, qualifiers dependencies and lifecycle hooks
2. Generate type-safe dependency injection code that creates and wires components correctly
3. Create initialization functions that handle all the wiring

## Usage

To use Go IoC in your project, install the GO IoC code generator:

```bash
go install github.com/tuhuynh27/go-ioc/cmd/iocgen@latest
```

Please ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is added to your $PATH.

### Defining Components

Components are defined using Go structs with specific annotations:

```go
// message/service.go
package message

type MessageService interface {
    SendMessage(msg string) string
}

type EmailService struct {
    Component struct{} // <- This is like a "@Component" annotation
    Implements struct{} `implements:"MessageService"` // <- Specify the interface that this struct implements
    Qualifier struct{} `value:"email"` // <- This is like a "@Qualifier" annotation
}

func (s *EmailService) SendMessage(msg string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Email: %s", msg)
}
```

### Defining Dependencies

Dependencies are defined using struct tags:

```go
// notification/service.go
package notification

type NotificationService struct {
    Component struct{}
    EmailSender message.MessageService `autowired:"true" qualifier:"email"` // <- This is like a "@Autowired" annotation
    SmsSender   message.MessageService `autowired:"true" qualifier:"sms"` // <- It also support "@Qualifier" annotation
}

func (s *NotificationService) SendNotifications(msg string) {
    s.EmailSender.SendMessage(msg)
    s.SmsSender.SendMessage(msg)
}
```

### Generating Initialization Code

Run the code generator in your project root:

```bash
iocgen
```

This will scan your project for components and generate the initialization code.

### Example Generated Code

Here's what the generated initialization code would look like:

```go
// wire/wire_gen.go
// Code generated by Go IoC. DO NOT EDIT.
//go:generate go run github.com/tuhuynh27/go-ioc/cmd/iocgen -dir=../
package wire

import (
    "your/project/message"
    "your/project/notification"
    "your/project/config"
)

type Container struct {
    EmailService        *message.EmailService
    SmsService          *message.SmsService
    NotificationService *notification.NotificationService
}

func Initialize() (*Container, func()) {
    container := &Container{}
    container.EmailService = &message.EmailService{}
    container.SmsService = &message.SmsService{}
    container.NotificationService = &notification.NotificationService{
        EmailSender: container.EmailService,
        SmsSender:   container.SmsService,
    }
    cleanup := func() {}
    return container, cleanup
}
```

### Using the Generated Code

Use the generated Application struct in your code:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "your/project/wire"
)

func main() {
    container, cleanup := wire.Initialize()
    defer cleanup()
    // Get the service you need
    notificationService := container.NotificationService
    // Use it
    notificationService.SendNotifications("Hello World!")
}
```

## FAQ

### What's the performance impact?

None! Go IoC:
- Uses pure compile-time code generation, without runtime state or reflection
- Has zero runtime overhead
- Generates plain Go code that's as efficient as hand-written dependency injection
